<strong>Hello Darkness</strong>
<p> Hello darkness, my old friend</p>
<p> I've come to talk with you again</p>
<p> Because a vision softly creeping</p>
<p> Left its seeds while I was sleeping</p>
<p> And the vision that was planted in my brain</p>
<p> Still remains</p>
<p> Within the sound of silence</p>
<p> In restless dreams, I walked alone</p>
<p> Narrow streets of cobblestone</p>
<p> 'Neath the halo of a street lamp</p>
<p> I turned my collar to the cold and damp</p>
<p> When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light</p>
<p> That split the night</p>
<p> And touched the sound of silence</p>
<p> And in the naked light, I saw</p>
<p> Ten thousand people, maybe more</p>
<p> People talking without speaking</p>
<p> People hearing without listening</p>
<p> People writing songs that voices never shared</p>
<p> And no one dared</p>
<p> Disturb the sound of silence</p>
<p> "Fools" said I, "You do not know</p>
<p> Silence like a cancer grows</p>
<p> Hear my words that I might teach you</p>
<p> Take my arms that I might reach you"</p>
<p> But my words, like silent raindrops fell</p>
<p> And echoed in the wells of silence</p>
<p> And the people bowed and prayed</p>
<p> To the neon god they made</p>
<p> And the sign flashed out its warning</p>
<p> In the words that it was forming</p>
<p> Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls</p>
<p> In tenement halls"</p>
<p> And whispered in the sound of silence </p>
